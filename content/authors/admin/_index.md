      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

      - Used effective prompt engineering and output formatting techniques to use LLMs for faster automatic annotation for classification tasks.
      - Optimized deployment of LLMs using Optimum (for ONNX conversion) and Nvidia TensorRT(TRT) format for further optimization. Used PyTorch Profiler to identify inference bottlenecks. Used Nvidia Triton Inference Server (TIS) as the default ML inference server for concurrent request serving and scheduling, batch inference and response caching.
      - Created REST APIs using FastAPI for hosting ML inference endpoints. Used MongoDB for response caching in NVIDIA Triton.
      - Used Qdrant vector DB for fast semantic searching, Dask to analyze and query big dataframes, DVC for dataset versioning and MLflow for model, artifact and experiment versioning.
      - Created pipeline for Natural Language generation (NLG) in Bangla for both encoder models like BERT and auto-regressive models like GPT2. Analyzed and overcame common issues like repetitive text generation, and unmeaningful word generation in NLG for Bangla.

I am Md. Motahar Mahtab, a skilled Machine Learning Engineer with a strong foundation in Computer Science. I hold a B.Sc in CSE from BRAC University, where I graduated with a CGPA of 3.99. With over two years of experience, I specialize in developing and deploying Large Language Models (LLMs), downstream solutions, and optimizing LLMs for various applications.

I work with advanced ML frameworks and tools, including PyTorch, Huggingface, Weights and Biases, LangChain, LangGraph, and Triton. During my time at Giga Tech Limited, I played a crucial role in implementing LLM training and deployment, downstream solutons using LLMs, LLM optimization and deployment and Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Currently, I am contributing to Delineate, a US-based startup that focuses on revolutionizing Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) through LLMs. I am actively seeking a PhD position in the USA to further specialize in the fields of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP).
